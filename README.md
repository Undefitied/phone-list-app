### Notes for reviewers
* exercise one, about mock server, I've got an idea to mock it faster with simple .json file in public folder, so I did it
* description about components and containers is not fully matched, because I saw some optimized way and changed the structure
* about styles, I've used Material UI, because I work with it on my current project and it was the fastest way for me to make app little more decent
